Calculator CLI App
A lightweight, command-line calculator built with Python that supports basic arithmetic operations. This project demonstrates clean code practices, user input handling, and error management in a functional CLI application.
🎯 Features

➕ Addition - Add two numbers
➖ Subtraction - Subtract two numbers
✖️ Multiplication - Multiply two numbers
➗ Division - Divide two numbers with zero-check protection
🔄 Continuous Operation - Perform multiple calculations in one session
✓ Input Validation - Handles invalid inputs gracefully

🚀 Quick Start
bashpython calculator.py
Then follow the on-screen menu to select operations and enter numbers.
📋 Requirements

Python 3.x
Terminal or Command Prompt

📝 Example Usage
Select operation:
1. Add       (+)
2. Subtract  (-)
3. Multiply  (*)
4. Divide    (/)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
